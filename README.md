# Book of Hacks
The ultimate book of tutorials based on hackathon projects (Suggested by @jonmarkgo)

# Structure
Each tutorial should have its own markdown file under the ```tutorials``` folder. Down the road, we will determine the best way to categorize our collections of tutorials (in a fashion similar to http://lifehackerbook.com/)

Please follow a format similar to the Portable Shower example and clone it as a starting point. I would highly recommend using images whenever possible. https://github.com/Hackathon-Hackers/book-of-hacks/blob/master/tutorials/Portable%20Shower.md

# Contributing
Just create a markdown file with the title of you hack and submit a pull request.
