# book-of-hacks
The ultimate book of tutorials based on hackathon projects (Suggested by @jonmarkgo)

# Structure
Each hack should have its own markdown file in its own chapter. Down the road, we will determine the best way to categorize our collections of tutorials (similar to http://lifehackerbook.com/)

# Contributing
Just create a markdown file with the title of you hack and submit a pull request.
